            <p class="pt-3 text-2xl"><span class="text-4xl font-semibold">var:</span> Before the advent of ES6, var
                declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it
                was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more
                before we discuss those issues.</p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-2xl"><span class="text-4xl font-semibold">let:</span> let is now preferred for variable
                declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the
                problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.</p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-2xl"><span class="text-4xl font-semibold">const:</span> Variables declared with the
                const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.</p>

            <h2 class="text-5xl font-bold">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
            <p class="pt-3 text-2xl"><span class="text-4xl font-semibold">null:</span> We have heard the word "null" many
                times in English. Its literal meaning is having no value. The same meaning is analogous to the meaning
                of null in programming.

                Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as null
                contains no value.

                When we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to show that
                the variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets assigned to a variable,
                it represents no value. The setting of the value must be done manually by the user as JavaScript never
                sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to null.</p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-2xl"><span class="text-4xl font-semibold">undefined:</span> There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a programmer, it is important that we understand it clearly.

                As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes undefined.
                
                Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.</p>

            <p class="pt-3 text-2xl">What is a REST API? An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
